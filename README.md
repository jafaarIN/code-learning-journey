# Machine Learning

The realm of AI and machine learning has always been interesting to me, but I haven't really taken the time to really delve into how neural networks truly work;
That changes now, I intend on being able to code an entire neural network from scratch in python and being able to fully explain the stages of a neural network and how it works.

I followed this youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3&index=1

NOTE: This repo was originally used to track my programming journey, I have decided to just dedicate it to machine learning, everything below is from the old README.md file

I started coding at around 9 years old using Lua (luau specifically) for game scripting. As my skills grew, I decided to make a shift to Python, and I've since dabbled in C++ and other low-level languages. This repo will track everything I learn such as concepts, languages, etc.

Languages I'm exploring:
- Lua: My starting point. Scripting logic and basic game mechanics.
- Python: My main language now. Used for automation, games and prototyping.
- C++: Learning memory management, performance, and OOP. I plan on improving my C++ knowledge soon.
- C: Planning to learn systems-level programming.
- Javascript: Frontend and backend development (node.js servers)
- HTML & CSS: While TECHNICALLY not programming languages (they're markup languages), they're still useful to know and I do hold a level of knowledge regarding them
- Others: I may explore Rust, Zig, or even make my own language.

Current Focus:

- Deep-diving into concepts that interest me, including:
  - Backpropagation and cross-entropy in machine learning
  - Algorithms in cryptography and how they work at a low level
- Strengthening my understanding of C++, with plans to transition into C afterwards
- Building low-level utilities to reinforce concepts on systems propgramming and memory management
