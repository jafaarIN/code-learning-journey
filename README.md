# code-learning-journey

I started coding at around 9 years old using Lua (luau specifically) for game scripting. As my skills grew, I decided to make a shift to Python, and I've since dabbled in C++ and other low-level languages. This repo will track everything I learn such as concepts, languages, etc.

üë®‚Äçüíª Languages I'm exploring:
- Lua: My starting point. Scripting logic and basic game mechanics.
- Python: My main language now. Used for automation, games and prototyping.
- C++: Learning memory management, performance, and OOP. I plan on improving my C++ knowledge soon.
- C: Planning to learn systems-level programming.
- Javascript: Frontend and backend development (node.js servers)
- HTML & CSS: While TECHNICALLY not programming languages (they're markup languages), they're still useful to know and I do hold a level of knowledge regarding them
- Others: I may explore Rust, Zig, or even make my own language.

Current Focus:

- Deep-diving into concepts that interest me, including:
  - Backpropagation and cross-entropy in machine learning
  - Algorithms in cryptography and how they work at a low level
- Strengthening my understanding of C++, with plans to transition into C afterwards
- Building low-level utilities to reinforce concepts on systems propgramming and memory management
