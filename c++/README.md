# C++ Learning journey

I've spent years coding in lua, python and a little bit of javascript. I've put time aside to learn the fundamentals of c++, but I've never really used it much and so I'm not too familiar with the language.
I want to expand my knowledge on C++ as I believe its a useful language to learn.

C++ shows you what's really happening underneath high-level abstractions:
- How memory works
- How variables live and die
- How performance can be controlled

It's used in a lot of things like operating systems, game engines, security tools, embedded systems, etc.
If I want to write *fast*, *efficient*, and *security-focused* software, I need to understand C++.
